# Snake_in_cpp_console

! Program written and tested in Dev-C++ 5.11 !


  The above file is one of my first projects. It was created at the end of 2017 as a credit for a subject related to the basics of programming. The rules of the game contained in the command have been implemented, but they closely resemble the classic version of the well-known Snake, and the inspiration was many materials available on the Internet. When creating a portfolio on github, I decided that it is worth posting this project here, because I felt that while writing it, I had acquired a lot of knowledge and skills in programming, and also discovered how much learning awaits me.
