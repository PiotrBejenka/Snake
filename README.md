# Snake_in_cpp_console

! Program written and tested in Dev-C++ 5.11 !


  The above file is one of my first projects. It was created at the end of 2017 as a credit for a subject related to the basics of programming. The rules of the game contained in the command have been implemented, but they closely resemble the classic version of the well-known Snake, and the inspiration was many materials available on the Internet. When creating a portfolio on github, I decided that it is worth posting this project here, because I felt that while writing it, I had acquired a lot of knowledge and skills in programming, and also discovered how much learning awaits me. \n
  A possible code update may appear if I have some spare time and it will probably include additional game modes, e.g. no board boundaries and appearing on the opposite side after crossing its edge, or endless survival mode. Another idea is to add more difficulty level control to the game - the speed of the snake and the amount of food eaten to win. Additionally, an interesting development of the application may be saving the list of results in a .txt file.
